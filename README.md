# Small-Business-Network-Design-with-Secure-E-commerce-server
This is my first time using Cisco Packet Tracer to create Computer Network Design. As we all know, fraudulent online actions pose a threat to small e-commerce businesses. I attempted to tackle the problem by adding security elements to the site to prevent malicious activity. The application is meant for a small business with 5 people that is accessible via the internet and has security measures such as https, public IP address, and firewall. NAT and NAC are used in this project to convert the private IP address to a public IP address.
