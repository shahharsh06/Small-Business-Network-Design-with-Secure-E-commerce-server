# Small-Business-Network-Design-with-Secure-E-commerce-server
This is my first experience to develop Computer Network Design in Cisco Packet Tracer. As we all are aware that small e-commerce business is facing challenges of malcious activities online. Here I tried to resolve issue by giving securities features to prevent malcious activities on site. 
The program is designed for a small business organisation i.e 5 users which was accessible to internet users using https and with a public IP address using Firewall to enhance security.
